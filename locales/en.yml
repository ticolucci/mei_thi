            mei_description: Mei loves movies, travelling and cooking. She also tries to learning painting, guitar and Portuguese. Growing up as single child in a small city, Mei spend her childhood with books and dogs. Because of all the reading of hero and fiction stories, Mei realized that kung fu was too hard to master, therefore she started to search her own way of life. After achieving another kind of master (in computer science), she joined a global company and started to travel a lot. She went to India as a student for a trainning programme, and three years later she went back as a trainer, where she met her loved Thi.

            thi_description: Thiago loves video games, music and movies. Addicted to chocolate, ice cream and hamburger. Nowadays a lovely chubby guy, in reality was born in São Paulo slim as a whip. Always joyful, he moved to Uberlandia at 10 years old together with his parents and younger brother. Went back to São Paulo with the whole family to study in a good university, where he found out his vocation for computer science and also a new addiction for Forró (traditional Brazilian couples dance). After the graduation and a failed attempt to build his own start-up with friends, he decided to join a bigger global company. One year and a half later, he had the great opportunity to change his life and go help on a trainning programme, where he met Mei - the love of his life.
